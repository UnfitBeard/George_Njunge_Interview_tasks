#The time the program takes to count frequencies for each letter 'n' is O(n).

#The time the program takes to output the keys and frequencies is denoted by O(k) where k in the number of distinct letter.this is due to Object.entries(count) taking O(k) time iterating through the keys of the object.

#Overall time complexity is :
O(k+n).

Optimization: The algoritm is relatively efficient.
